# GPU-Accelerated-Computing


GPU-accelerated computing uses a graphics processing unit (GPU) to perform computations typically performed by a central processing unit (CPU). GPUs are designed to handle large amounts of data in parallel, making them well-suited for tasks that require high-speed processing of large datasets, such as machine learning, scientific simulations, and data analytics. In addition, offloading computation to the GPU makes it possible to achieve significant speedup over CPU-only computation and perform computations that would be impractical or impossible to perform otherwise. 





Usage
Simply run the script in a terminal or command prompt to see the output.


Dependencies:

1. NVIDIA driver
2. nvidia-smi command line tool


Output:
- If a GPU is connected, the script will display information about the GPU including its usage, memory, and temperature.
- If a GPU is not connected, the script will display a message saying that there is no GPU connection.
